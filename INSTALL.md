How to run the Engine:
----------------------

-run *main.py* to start the Program

*main.py will start splash screen and run the project manager*

*I recommend to always start by running main.py to not encounter any errors*

-run *project_manager.py* to directly start the project manager

-when *Editor.py* the editor will start with the last project you opened

*if you never opened a project it will close after starting*
