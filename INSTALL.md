How to run the Engine:
----------------------

-run *main.py* to start the Program\n
*main.py will start splash screen and run the project manager*\n
*I recommend to always start by running main.py to not encounter any errors*\n

-run *project_manager.py* to directly start the project manager\n

-when *Editor.py* the editor will start with the last project you opened\n
*if you never opened a project it will close after starting*
