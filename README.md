# Artix Engine - 2D Python Game Engine

Artix Engine is a 2D game engine written in Python that offers visual programming through an event system and provides object behaviors called attributes. It includes a file manager for importing textures, a built-in physics engine, and a project manager to efficiently organize your game projects. With Artix Engine, you can export your games to a Python file, which uses the Pygame library to run and supports high frame rates of up to 200 FPS.

## Features

- **Visual Programming:** Artix Engine allows you to create games using a graphical editor, eliminating the need for coding skills. The event system and attributes make it easy to define object behaviors and interactions.

- **File Manager:** The engine provides a file manager within the editor, enabling you to import textures and other game assets seamlessly.

- **Built-in Physics Engine:** Artix Engine comes with a physics engine based on Pymunk, allowing you to incorporate realistic physics into your games effortlessly.

- **Project Manager:** The project manager in Artix Engine simplifies the management of your game projects, providing a streamlined workflow and easy access to all your resources.

- **Game Export:** You can export your games as Python files, which can be executed using Pygame. This feature allows you to share your games with others and run them on various platforms.

- **High Frame Rates:** Exported games from Artix Engine can achieve frame rates of up to 200 FPS, ensuring smooth and responsive gameplay experiences.
